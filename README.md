# laravel-starter
Laravel Starter with Fortify integration and starter template

# Instructions 

All files should already be in place. Run the migrations to setup Fortify and everything else (including the views for the various Fortify processes) should be taken care off.

## Steps to follow

* Download composer.phar from composer: https://getcomposer.org/download/
* Download example .env (when missing): https://github.com/laravel/laravel/blob/master/.env.example
* php artisan migrate
* Check if registration is enabled in config/fortify.php
